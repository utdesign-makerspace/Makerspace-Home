## New website

The UTDesign Makerspace website has received a new look. We wanted to upgrade our landing page to look more modern and showcase more images of the space. On top of that, we've added taglines that showcase how everyone is encouraged to work on projects in the Makerspace.

## New calendar

Our calendar has been adjusted to have a modern look. Users on mobile will now view the calendar as a list instead of a grid. Events also now include a link to add an event to your Google Calendar. However, we understand not everyone uses Google Calendar and we are looking for other ways to have members add events.
