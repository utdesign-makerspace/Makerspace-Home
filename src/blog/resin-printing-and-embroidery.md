W﻿e are excited to announce that we are bringing two new types of equipment to UTDesign Makerspace! Please read more about them below and view our full equipment list [here](https://wiki.utd.ms/equipment).

## R﻿esin Printing

H﻿ave you ever wanted to print a highly-detailed miniature for Dungeons & Dragons? Do you want a custom keycap but rough PLA just doesn't feel right on your fingers? We've got you covered.

S﻿tarting today, we have a resin printing station accessible in our digital fabrication room. It is stocked with an Anycubic Photon Mono, an orbital shaker for rinsing your prints, and a UV curing station. We hope to expand this station with an Anycubic Photon Mono X in the future. All members interested in using this station need to complete [the required training](https://learn.utd.ms/), so make sure to get that done first.

## Embroidery and Sewing

W﻿e are happy to announce that our fundraiser for an embroidery machine has been funded! Thanks to the generosity of our members (which you can view [here](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?campaign_id=XT278LVCJGG7G)), we were able to raise over $400 to buy a new embroidery and sewing machine.

Starting today, all members have access to our new Brother SE600, a computerized embroidery and sewing machine. The machine is very complex since a lot of its settings are configured both digitally and physically, so make sure to take your time and be very careful. Though no training is required, we highly recommend all members read the manuals in the top drawer next to the station or online [here](https://support.brother.com/g/b/manualtop.aspx?c=us&lang=en&prod=hf_se600eus).
