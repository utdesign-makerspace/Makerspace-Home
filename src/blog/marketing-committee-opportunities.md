## Digital Artist - Marketing Committee Officer

We are looking for a digital artist to serve on the marketing committee. You will be asked to help whenever we need digital art, typically for merchandise and promotional materials.

* Be able to manage time efficiently and meet deadlines
* Be able to lead members of a committee when needed

* Have a portfolio of other forms of art (optional)

## Marketing Committee Member

We are looking for marketing committee members to help with giving feedback on marketing projects and creating merchandise concepts to be executed by our graphic designer and digital artist. Creating and voting on unique ideas (ex. 3D printed keychains) will be assigned to members based on their skill set and the marketing committee will be expected to work together to produce these for students as needed.

You will be expected to meet the following requirements:

* Be enrolled as a student at The University of Texas at Dallas
* Have a way to commute to UTDesign Makerspace as needed
* Be able to print stickers and assemble other merchandise throughout the week
