W﻿e are excited to introduce you to our new digital fabrication room. There's a lot to unpack here, so we would like to give you every detail of this new space. Before introducing the new technology, we want to l﻿et you know when the room will be available and update you on some new requirements for our existing services.

## A﻿vailability

W﻿e currently plan for the digital fabrication room to be available by October 21st at the latest. However, major changes like this take time. You should be able to access the room with your Comet Card as long as you meet the requirements below once the room is available. We will also post a small announcement on [our Discord server](https://utd.ms/discord) once the room is ready.

## N﻿ew Requirements

F﻿or the safety of our members and technology, we have a few new requirements that all members using our digital fabrication room must follow.

### Comet Card Access

T﻿he digital fabrication room has a Comet Card scanner mounted to the doorway. To protect our technology and ensure only members who are aware of our emergency equipment and protocols have access to our hazardous equipment, all members must complete the [General & Safety Training](https://learn.utd.ms/) to gain access to this room.

Upon completion of the training, it may take up to five business days for you to gain access. Alumni may also be ineligible for access without a student, faculty, or staff partner. We understand this is not ideal for all of our members, but all technology will remain available to alumni as long as they gain entry to the room.

### Partner System

D﻿ue to the hazardous nature of a majority of the technology in the digital fabrication room, we are requiring a partner system for use of the laser cutter, CNC router, and resin printing (still a work in progress) stations moving forward.

W﻿hen using the above stations, members will now be required to have another member who is at minimum trained in the [General & Safety Training](https://learn.utd.ms/) present. However, we prefer that members have their partner trained in the technology they are using.

## Technology

Now the part you've been waiting for. The below technology (excluding the laser cutter) will likely be made available over time due to us needing to test it further and create trainings.

### L﻿aser Cutter

O﻿ur Glowforge Basic is a long-time part of the Makerspace. Previously stored in a small storage closet, it now has more room to breathe and a small area for scrap material to its side.

### R﻿esin Printing*

W﻿e are preparing an Anycubic Photon Mono and Anycubic Photon Mono X (still in testing) for public use. Resin printing is significantly more difficult and hazardous than the FDM printing we already offer, so it will take us some time to finalize the station setup.

### C﻿NC Router*

A﻿lthough it was donated quite a while back, we are finalizing the setup of a Genmitsu 3018-PRO that will be available to members after they complete a brief training. More information about this station will come soon.

\*﻿This station is not yet available and is coming soon.
