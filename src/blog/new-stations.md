We've been working hard over the summer to make new stations available to our members. In this blog post, we will discuss the new stations available to our members, including ways they can be used and how to gain access to them.

# Virtual reality

Our virtual reality station is ready for public use. We have had our members express interest in using our virtual reality equipment in the past, but we have never had a formal software setup and training process created. We now have a variety of applications ready for use on the virtual reality PC as well as a formal training on our website.

We believe the virtual reality station will serve a wide variety of uses for our members.

- Developers can create games using Unity and its various virtual reality packages.
- Gamers can play virtual reality games we own using Steam.
- Educators and students can learn using applications like Google Earth VR.

The virtual reality station is **now available** to those who have completed the [mandatory training](https://learn.utd.ms/).

# Resin printing

In the past, our goal with resin printing was to have officers complete all resin prints for students. However, the main goal of the Makerspace has always been to provide tools and resources for students to create their projects. Because of this, we are changing our model from a paid service to officer-supervised printing.

Switching to an officer supervision model will allow students to learn about the resin printing process themselves. Once they are ready to print their 3D model, they will be able to do so safely under close supervision by an officer also trained in resin printing.

Resin printing can be used for all sorts of purposes.

- Resin printers are significantly higher quality.
- Resin is commonly used for miniatures, keyboard caps, and more.
- Members can offer their skill with resin printing as a service to others wanting prints.

The resin printing station and its mandatory training will be **available at the start of the Fall 2022 semester**. More information will be given in a later blog post.
