H﻿ey everyone and happy Halloween! We have a few exciting announcements to share today.

## Discord Server Subscriptions

Starting today, you can support UTDesign Makerspace through Discord server subscriptions! For a small monthly cost, you can get exclusive perks on our Discord server and free merch (see terms in subscription). All payment processing is handled by Discord, so no need to worry about sending us your info.

W﻿e rarely remind members about donations, but please consider subscribing or making a one-time or recurring donation [at our store](https://utd.ms/store). We rely entirely on member donations and sponsorships from companies. With your help, we can continue repairing existing services and providing new ones for free to all members.

Y﻿ou can access server subscriptions through our new Server Shop at the top of the channel list in [our Discord server](https://utd.ms/discord).

## New PC Workstations

Starting next semester, we will have new PC workstations available for all members because of your generous support on [Comets Giving Days](https://givingday.utdallas.edu/giving-day/66639/department/75249) last semester and funding from the [ECS Student Council](https://www.instagram.com/utd.ecs.stuco/). We look forward to seeing the variety of ways students and organizations use these PCs, including...

* 3D modeling parts for use with our 3D printers
* Game and software development during events like game jams and hackathons
* Completing Makerspace training for access to our tools
* Hosting gaming socials

## Merchandise Plans

S﻿tarting next semester, we plan to start launching new merch every semester. Our current plans are as follows but may be subject to change...

* A member-created line of merch (shirts, tote bags, etc.) every Spring semester
* An officer-created line of merch (shirts, tote bags, etc.) every Fall semester
* New seasonal sticker packs as available
